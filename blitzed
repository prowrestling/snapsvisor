Almost heaven
West Virginia
Blue Ridge mountains
Shenandoah river
Life is old there older than the trees
Younger than the mountains growin' like a breeze
Country roads take me home to the place I belong
West Virginia mountain momma
Take me home country roads
All my memories gather 'round her
Miner's lady stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine teardrop in my eye
Country roads take me home to the place I belong
West Virginia mountain momma
Take me home country roads
I hear her voice in the mornin' hour she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
And drivin' down the road
I get a feelin' that I should have been home yesterday, yesterday
Country roads take me home to the place I belong
West Virginia mountain momma
Take me home country roads
Country roads take me home to the place I belong
West Virginia mountain momma
Take me home country roads
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
West Virginia mountain momma
Take me home country roads
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
West Virginia mountain momma
Take me home country roads
Take me home country roads
Take me home country roads
